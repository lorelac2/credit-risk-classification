# Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use various techniques to train and evaluate a cassification model based on loan risk, to label them as either healthy or high-risk. The data is comprised of variables inlcuding loan size, interest rates, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory amrks, total debt, and loan status.
&nbsp;

A logisitic regression model was created using testing sets of the data. Predictions were made with the model, then the model's performance was evaluated by generating the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. 
&nbsp;

Secondly, another logistic regression model was created using RandomOverSampler to resample the data.
